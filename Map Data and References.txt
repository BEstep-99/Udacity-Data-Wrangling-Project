Map Data
Charlotte, NC on OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/177415
Charlotte is one of the two largest cities in NC, the other being Raleigh. Charlotte is the most westward of the two cities, and a hub for travel and trade on the east coast. I chose Charlotte because it is the closest major city to where I live, and I visit it fairly often.
